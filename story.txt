It all started when I drove my Porsche through a Baeckerei.
It wasn't my fault though, Rammstein on the radio had taken me over.
When I hear them, I have the irresistible urge to throw on my Lederhose and speed to the Ratskeller.
While I was okay, I'm still cleaning brot out of my Klimaanlage.
On top of it all, I forgot to buy the Gebaeck that I had gone there for.
But I did remember my twelve Brot from the store.
